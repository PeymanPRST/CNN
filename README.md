Crack Detection CNN Model
This project contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed to classify images as containing cracks or not. The model was trained on a dataset of crack and non-crack images to learn the patterns distinguishing between the two classes.

Project Structure
data/ - Contains folders of raw crack and non-crack images used for training and testing
models/ - Saved Keras CNN model files

Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of:

3 convolutional layers with 3x3 kernels and ReLU activations
MaxPooling layers after each convolution
Flatten layer
256-unit Dense layer with ReLU
Sigmoid output layer for binary classification
It is compiled with binary_crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer.

Training Process
The images are pre-processed by resizing to 224x224 pixels and normalizing. They are then split into train and test sets.

The model trains for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32. Validation loss and accuracy are monitored to check for overfitting.

A final test accuracy of 100% shows the model can accurately classify new crack/non-crack images.

Future Improvements
Areas that could potentially improve the model:

Larger dataset for training
Data augmentation to introduce more variations
Try different network architectures like ResNet
Transfer learning from pre-trained models
